# Weather-Website
In This Website I have used weather API which fetches the data of weather and displays the current weather conditions of City.

This application provides users with current weather information and forecasts for various cities using a weather API. Users can retrieve data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, for their desired location.

2. **Access**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5500` in your web browser to access the application.

## Usage

- **Search**: Enter the desired city in the search bar and press enter or click the search button.

- **Forecast**: Check the weather forecast for the upcoming days.

## Technologies Used
